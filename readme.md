# AI-Powered Search and Summarization

This project integrates the **Tavily API** for advanced search and **Google Gemini API** for natural language processing, to provide AI-powered insights based on user queries. It allows the user to search for specific topics (such as reviews or news), summarizes the gathered content, and provides sentiment or financial analysis.

## Features
- **Advanced Search**: Uses the Tavily API to search for content based on user queries.
- **Summarization**: Provides sentiment, financial, or general insights based on the context retrieved.
- **Feedback Logging**: Logs user feedback about the generated responses.
- **Chat History**: Saves queries, responses, and user feedback in a history file for reference.
  
## Requirements
Make sure to have the following environment variables set in the `.env` file:
- `TAVILY_API_KEY`: Your API key for the Tavily service.
- `GOOGLE_KEY`: Your API key for the Google Gemini API.
